                                    <p class="text-justify">Here we list out some of the benefits you can enjoy while having a website for your business: </p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <h6><li>24/7 Online Presence.</li></h6>
                                        <p class="text-justify">One of the major advantages of having a website is that it is accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime.

The website is always at work to ensure that customers who come in are always served in the comfort of their homes.</p>
                                        
                                        <h6><li>24/7 Customer Support.</li></h6>
                                        <p class="text-justify">Providing customer support is a tough job for any business. However, providing customer support online is easier and more cost-efficient than hiring personnel to provide support. This is where the importance of having a website becomes clear as customer support through a website can be provided in various ways:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><p class="text-justify"></p><strong>FAQs-</strong> This is the most commonly used medium. All the frequent customer queries are answered on the website, saving your time and resources, while also providing precise and relevant information to customers.</li>
                                            <li><p class="text-justify"></p><strong>Chatbots-</strong> Chatbots on websites also do the job of addressing frequent customer queries through template answers. Chatbots can also provide users with many other important pieces of information like signing-up procedures, information about services/products, and so on.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h6><li>Information Exchange.</li></h6>
                                        <p class="text-justify">Over 50% of the customers expect any brand or business to have an online presence where they can access their services. One of the most captivating aspects of a website is how easy it makes information accessible to customers. At its core, a website is nothing but a medium to communicate with customers and to provide them with information and resources. Here are a few ways in which websites help in exchanging information:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Advertisements that update customers about the latest offers on products and services.</li>
                                            <li>Newsletters that update customers about any upcoming events and news.</li>
                                            <li>Contact forms that invite enquiries or requests from customers.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h6><li>Establish Credibility and Build Trust.</li></h6>
                                        <p class="text-justify">Just like in the old days, when customers expected businesses to have contact numbers and addresses mentioned in their information brochure, customers nowadays expect businesses to have a website or online presence. This is a crucial first step in establishing trust. From this perspective, for a business, a website is highly important. 
                                            To take it a bit further, if a business’s website is superlative in its features and navigation, customers are more inclined to trust the business and avail of their services. Websites are an essential tool for businesses to establish their credibility and build trust with their customers. This can then be further boosted by local SEO services to attract a local demographic for businesses who might be new in the market.</p>
                                        
                                        <h6><li>Professional Web Design</li></h6>
                                        <p class="text-justify">Website visitors have no reason to stay on any Web page unless they’re tempted to. Visitors can get bored very easily and expect something unique to capture their interest whenever they’re visiting any website. 
                                            Hence, it is crucial that businesses build their websites with immaculate design and architecture so that customers are offered exceptional features and convenient navigation. This will encourage more visitors to take a peek at your website, and potentially buy from your business.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Sales</strong></li>
                                            <p class="text-justify">The accessibility of your business grows exponentially with a website, as it can be accessed from any corner of the world. Hence, websites help businesses break geographical barriers and significantly increase their sales.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Revenue</strong></li>
                                            <p class="text-justify">There is no limit to the revenue that could be generated by your website. If the reach of your website can cross the borders, the revenue can reach sky high. All you need to do is optimise your site and make sure that your audience finds you when they are looking for you. Besides that, you can also give some of your digital space on your website for display ads. 
                                                Let’s say your site is about reviewing or selling mobile phones. You can give some of your digital space on your website to display ads relevant to these phones. This is just an additional way with which you can generate more revenue.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong></li>
                                            <p class="text-justify">A physical store requires a massive investment for owning or renting a commercial space. Besides that, furniture, interiors, and employees are also some additional expenses that cannot be ignored. On the other hand, creating a website is very easy and cost-effective. 
                                                With CMS like WordPress, Shopify, or Wix, one can easily create a website with little or no help. Only if you are setting up a complex website like E-commerce or one with thousands of pages, or complex filters and facets, then you might need the help of experts. However, the cost can still be minimal in comparison with setting up the physical store.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Visibility</strong></li>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Websites can become your online store, office, or showroom at a very minimal cost. A physical store will have visibility within a particular radius of its location, depending on its type. 
                                                However, when it comes to a business with an online presence, the visibility or the reach has no bound. Users from any part of the world can access the website.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Marketing</strong></li>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Marketing plays a crucial role in the expansion of any business. Having a website makes it pretty easy to spread a word about your business when people are searching for them. Let us say your offline business is doing well, and now you want to expand it online. 
                                                If you have a website, you can make it appear on a Search Engine whenever people search using a keyword. There are two types of marketing methods that make this possible.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Portfolio</strong></li>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Do not limit your website for just selling products or services. Create a portfolio that shows how well you are doing in the business. Let us say your business is into travel and tourism. 
                                                You can create a video portfolio of a family that shows their overall experience from booking tickets to taking trip pictures all the fun. You can ask them to share their feedback in a video format and add it to the portfolio video. Such portfolios help build the trust of people into your business.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Having a website has become crucial in this digital age. A business with no website loses multiple opportunities that can come online. Apart from these essential benefits, a website has to offer, it also helps in numerous other ways. For example, a website can provide a map or directions to their business locations or offices. 
                                                If someone wants to know about a business at their convenient hour, a website can help them with the same since it is accessible at any time. A well designed and engaging website can strengthen the brand image. To become a successful business person, you must have a professional website.</p>
