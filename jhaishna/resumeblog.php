                                    <p class="text-justify">You can't just start writing a resume by putting your info together in the resume template all willy-nilly.<br/>
                                        Instead, first select from the standard resume formats:</p>

                                    <h6>Reverse-chronological Format</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Pros: Traditional resume style, familiar to potential employers<br/>
                                        Cons: Very common, not the most creative resume design format.</p>-->

                                    <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote">
                                        <p>Don't get so busy making a Living that you forget to make a Life.</p>
                                        <footer class="blockquote-footer">Dolly Parton.</footer>
                                    </blockquote> -->

                                    <!--<h6>Combination Format</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Pros: Great for experienced pros and career changers for highlighting transferable skills.<br/>
                                        Cons: Uncommon type, not as familiar, not recommended for entry-level job seekers.</p>

                                    <h6>Functional Format (skills-based)</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Pros: Entry-level job hunters can emphasize skills over lack of experience.<br/>
                                        Cons: HR managers may think you're hiding something.</p>

                                    <p class="text-justify">Most job applicants will likely want to choose the reverse-chronological resume template. The chronological resume is a traditional resume format which emphasizes your duties, experience, and work history. 
                                        You'll list your most recent positions first, and go back through past jobs in reverse-chronological order from there. As the standard, basic resume format, it tends to be the easiest to read and scan.</p>

                                    <p class="text-justify">As for the question of how to spell resume? It's still a bone of contention, but we think a resume without the accents is the best choice.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">To learn more about the best resume format to use for your particular situation, compare the common resume format examples, or check out our articles on the chronological, combination, or functional formats and resume design. 
                                        And also take a look at our guide to free resume templates.</p>

                                    <h5>2. Add your Contact Information and Personal Details.</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">A career diplomat knows what information should be given and which to hold back.<br/>
                                    Likewise, on a great resume contact information section, there are basic items which you must include, personal details that are recommended, and some data which you should definitely leave out:</p>

                                    <h6>Necessary Contact Information</h6>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Name: First name, last name (middle name optional).</li>
                                        <li>Phone Number: Personal cell phone preferred over home phone number.</li>
                                        <li>Email Address: Today's preferred means of communication.</li>
                                        <li>LinkedIn URL: Include your LinkedIn profile (hiring managers will spy on you anyway).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="text-justify">&emsp;Optional:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Leave your address off your resume (unless required).</li>
                                        <li>Resume title.</li>
                                        <li>Personal website.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Personal websites and social media are now a normal thing to list on a resume header.</p>

                                    <h5>3. Contact Information to Avoid</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify"><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> Adding your birthdate could lead to ageism. Add only if required, such as for jobs serving alcohol, for example.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify"><strong>Second Email or Phone Number:</strong> A second email address, mailing address, or phone number will just confuse them (and you).</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify"><strong>Photo/Headshot:</strong> In the United States, resume images and profile photos are usually not recommended.</p>

                                    <h5>4. Start with a Heading Statement (Resume Summary or Resume Objective)</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Most Tinder users have little patience. It takes a witty statement or provocative image to get a match not to swipe left on you.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Well, the employer flips through resumes just like a Tinder user with an attention deficit. In less than 7 seconds, as our HR statistics report shows, hiring managers scan your resume and make an initial decision.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">That's why a professional resume heading statement is super-important to get right. You've got to compose a statement, with wit, that paints an attractive image of your candidacy. After all, what is the purpose of a resume but to give the best impression of your clout as a candidate.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Your resume summary statement or resume objective statement are likely to have the most eye time since it's at the top of the page.</p>

                                    <h5>5. Resume Summary Statement</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Got enough relevant experience? Choose the resume summary statement.<br/>
                                    A good resume summary works when you apply at a job in which you have experience. It summarizes your position-related skills and qualifications.</P>

                                    <div class="post-preview"><img src="assets/img/blog/format.jpg" alt="format" class="img-fluid" /></div><br/>

                                    <h5>6. List Your Relevant Work Experience & Key Achievements</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">If you think of your resume as a fancy meal, the resume experience section is the main course. It includes the most important things to put on a resume.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">You've knocked out the appetizer with the previous sections, so now it's time to fill in your work history and past achievements before moving on.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Job Title—</strong> This should go at the very top of each entry of work history so that it's easy for potential employers to scan and find. Make it bold and/or increase the font size by 1pt or 2pts from the rest of the entry.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Company, City, State—</strong> On the second line, include the previous employer's company name, and the city and state of the location you worked at.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Dates Employed—</strong> Thirdly, put the timeframe of your employment there. You can add the year or both the month and the year, but there's no need to put exact days.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Key Responsibilities—<strong> Don't just list every single task you did in your job history. Focus on the few duties most relevant to the new job.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Key Achievements—</strong> Often overlooked, but super important. Employers know what you did, but they need to know how well you did them.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Keywords—</strong> It is important to sprinkle resume keywords throughout the experience section (we'll talk more about this shortly).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="text-justify">If adding more than one job history entry to your resume or CV experience section, start with the most recent position and go back in reverse-chronological order from there.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Use five or six bullet points to make your case in each entry's responsibilities and achievements.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Also, your experience section resume bullet points should go near the top, just under your heading statement. However, if you have little or no professional experience, put your education section above your work history.</p>

                                    <h5>7. Tailoring your resume work experience</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Robots are taking over.<br/>
                                        As hiring practices continue to modernize, larger companies are turning to applicant tracking systems (ATS) to give them a hand. ATS software automates the early stages of the recruitment process. How? They look for keywords and assign a score per candidate.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">So, tailoring your resume is an absolute must, and your experience section is where you'll do most of it.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">To tailor your resume, go back to the job description and look for resume keywords related to your responsibilities.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">If you see duties you've performed, include them in your resume job description bullet points.<br/>
                                        Experienced a spell of unemployment? Don't worry! Check out our guide on how to explain gaps in your resume.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Tailoring your resume also involves knowing how long a resume should be. There are pros and cons for a one-page resume and the two-page resume, but avoid anything longer.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Also, don't use the same, tired words ("responsible for…") in your resume job experience area. Instead, choose power words and action verbs which will keep them interested. Use present tense to describe your current job and past tense to talk about previous experience.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Finally, don't use passive voice, as it feels evasive and unclear. Instead, choose an active voice when writing a resume, as it's concise and to the point.</p>

                                    <h5>8. How much work experience to include on a resume?</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">In principle, a resume should go back no more than 10-15 years. But the more experience you have, the less you should worry about the length of your resume. Don't go trying to cram everything into a 1 page resume if you're a highly-experienced candidate.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Senior-level applicants, such as executives and managers, should list up to 15 years of relevant work experience with powerful action verbs to introduce each bullet point.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Mid-level job seekers should include detailed job descriptions of relevant positions and a brief mention of any other positions.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Entry-level candidates should list and describe all paid work, particularly calling out responsibilities and achievements that are most relevant.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">First-time job hunters with no work experience can still include other history, such as a student organization role, internship, or volunteer experience, to fill out their experience section.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">As you learn how to write a resume, remember the best resume templates will highlight your experience and eligibility. Don't hide it with the wrong order, a dull resume layout, or a template free of character. With dozens of good resume examples, templates, and styles, Zety is the best resume builder online.</p>

                                    <h5>9. List Your Education Correctly</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Many people treat the education section as an afterthought, but you shouldn't. It's an essential part of your resume structure.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Here's how to put education on your resume so you don't get schooled:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The right resume education order is to place your highest degree first.</li>
                                        <li>Add any other degrees after in reverse-chronological order.</li>
                                        <li>If you finished a university degree, don't add high school info.</li>
                                        <li>Some colleges on a resume are also fine, just list completed credits.</li>
                                        <li>Add any relevant coursework, honors, or awards (e.g., making Dean's List) you received.</li>
                                        <li>Extracurricular activities are a nice finishing touch.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h5>10. Put Relevant Skills that Fit the Job Ad</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Your resume is one of these two: it's either unprepared to be served, or it's a good resume, the prime cut sprinkled with the perfect resume skills.</p>

                                    <h6>Hard skills vs. soft skills</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Hard skills are specific abilities and know-how (e.g., Photoshop, cash register).</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Soft skills are self-developed, life-learned attributes (e.g., social skills, adaptability).</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Combined, these make up a skill set, which is a job seeker's range of skills and abilities.</p>

                                    <h5>11. Include Additional Important Resume Sections</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Here's the thing—everyone's resumes include those sections above. But what should a resume include to make it personalized?</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Make your resume unique by including extra resume sections.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Additional sections on your CV/resume can showcase just about anything about you, from your proud commendations to languages in which you're fluent and more.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Here's how to make your resume stand out with extra sections:</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify"><strong>Hobbies and interests</strong></p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">You might not think that your love of baseball and being the Little League assistant coach would be of interest to a potential employer.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">However, listing your hobbies and interests subtly proves your ability to work well in a team, and the coaching can verify your leadership and management expertise.</p>

                                    <h6>Volunteer Work</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Volunteering boosts employability, studies find. For most job seekers, listing any volunteer experience as one of your additional CV sections is a great way to show your commitment and values. 
                                        It also lets them know that you don't only care about the money. For entry-level or first-time applicants who have no experience, volunteer work makes an excellent stand-in.</p>

                                    <h6>Internship Experience</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Listing internships on your resume is only OK if you're fresh out of school, had one or two other jobs, or you haven't been on the market for longer than 4-5 years.</p>

                                    <h6>Certifications and awards</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Got any certifications, licenses, or proud awards to show off? If they are relevant to the job and industry, include them!</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Placed first in a chili cook-off at the state fair? If you're looking to be a cook, it will definitely help. Likewise, a food safety certification or food handler's license that you already have would surely be in your favor.</p>

                                    <h6>Languages</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Speak another language? Impressive!</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Listing language skills on a resume only extends your usefulness as an employee, particularly in international corporations or localities where there is a large population speaking that second language. 
                                        List the language, international variation (Latin American Spanish, for example), and your language fluency levels.</p>
                                    
                                    <h6>Projects</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">You can include projects as a separate section if you've done a bunch or simply mention one or two below each job description.</p>

                                    <h6>Publications</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Have articles written for a blog, newspaper, or scientific journal? Mention those publications on a resume. If your published material isn't online, create a short bibliography of the works you'd like them to acknowledge.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Also, if you've built graphic designs or other creative creations, or if your list of publications or projects is too long to go on a resume, consider building an online portfolio to document everything. Link to it from the contact section, in this case.</p>

                                    <h5>12. Complement Your Resume With a Cover Letter</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">You need to submit a cover letter, most definitely.<br/>
                                    Your cover letter or job application letter lets you expand upon things that you need to keep brief on your resume. Also, it allows you to speak easily in normal sentences!</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Sounds like overkill?Think again.<br/>
                                    Most employers think a resume is not enough to make a decision.<br/></p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Follow our guide on how to make a cover letter (or a cover letter with no experience or cover letter for an internship), and you'll knock this out quickly and painlessly.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Plus, a great cover letter that matches your resume will give you an advantage over other candidates.</p>

                                    <h5>13. Proofread, Save, and Email Your Resume the Right Way</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">You're almost there, but don't send it off just yet.Here are some resume best practices to keep in mind so you can rest assured that you wrote the perfect resume.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Proofread & double-check<br/>
                                    Double-check your CV or resume draft before sending it out. Scan your resume and cover letter (and email!) with a tool like Grammarly. Then, ask a friend or family member to triple-check. Better safe than sorry!</p>

                                    <h5>14. Online presence</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Remember when we discussed social media and LinkedIn back in the contact section? Well, do you remember the naked pictures you posted onto Facebook several months ago? Yeah, those have to come down.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Before a recruiter or hiring manager gets the chance to look you and your employment history up, you better have your online presence sanitized! That means removing any offensive posts, or at least marking them private while you're preparing your resume. While you're at it, tweak your LinkedIn profile so that it's up-to-date and complete.</p>

                                    <h5>15. Saving your Resume</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Word Doc or PDF? Resumes in PDF are prefered by hiring managers. Recruiters prefer resumes in Microsoft Word .doc format. In the end, go with you like better (and know that our builder will let you download in both file formats). And if you're creating your resume in Word, remember that saving it as a PDF is a better way of preserving your formatting.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">How to save your resume? Use a resume naming convention across all your attachments that includes your name, hyphens or underscores, the position you're targeting, and the word resume or cover letter.</p>

                                    <p class="text-justify">Choose a clean, professional font like Arial, Calibri, or Garamond, and stick with it throughout your document.</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>Keep it Clean and Uncluttered</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Use plenty of white space, and don’t overcrowd the page. This makes it easier for the human eye and the ATS to process information.</p>

                                    <p class="text-justify">A pop of color or a simple line divider can help your resume stand out, but don't overdo it. Remember, the content is what truly shines.</p>
                                    <h5>Save in the Right Format</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Unless specified otherwise, save your resume as a PDF to preserve its formatting for both human and machine readers.</p>

                                    <h3>Telling Your Story Through Strategic Content and Personal Branding</h3>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Your resume should read like a story—a narrative that starts with a strong lead and captivates the reader from the first word to the last.</p>

                                    <h5>Tailor Each Resume to the Job</h5>

                                    <h5>Focus on Achievements Over Responsibilities</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Showcasing your accomplishments can set you apart. Use numbers and tangible results to quantify your impact in previous roles.</p>

                                    <h5>Prepare Your Story for Experience Gaps or Career Changes</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">If you have employment gaps or are changing careers, address these head-on with honesty and confidence. Highlight relevant coursework, freelance work, or transferable skills to bridge those gaps.</p>

                                    <p class="text-justify">Beyond aesthetics and storytelling, strategic formatting and language use can significantly sway the odds in your favor.</p>
                                    <h5>Use Action Verbs</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Begin each bullet point with a powerful action verb to describe your roles and accomplishments. This creates a more dynamic, engaging read.</p>
                                    <h5>Prioritize Content with Relevance</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">On average, you have about 1-5 minutes to impress a recruiter. Make those seconds count by positioning the most relevant information front and center.</p>
                                    <h5>Quantify and Qualify Accomplishments</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">When discussing achievements, use numbers to quantify successes and adjectives to qualify them. Both add weight and believability to your claims.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Final Touches: Proofreading, Review, and Ongoing Maintenance</h3>

                                    <p class="text-justify">Grammatical mistakes or typos can sink an otherwise stellar resume. Double and triple-check your document, or get a fresh pair of eyes to review it.</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>Seek Feedback</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Ask a mentor, a trusted confidant, for their opinion. Constructive feedback can often reveal overlooked areas for improvement</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>Tailor Your Resume for Every Application</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Yes, it's more work, but tailoring your resume increases your chances of landing an interview. Even small adjustments can make a big difference in demonstrating your fit for the role.</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>Maintain an Ongoing Portfolio</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">: Keep a living document of all your accomplishments, skills, and experience over time. This will make it easier to update your resume as you progress in your career.</p>

                                   <!-- <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Job Title—</strong> This should go at the very top of each entry of work history so that it's easy for potential employers to scan and find. Make it bold and/or increase the font size by 1pt or 2pts from the rest of the entry.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Company, City, State—</strong> On the second line, include the previous employer's company name, and the city and state of the location you worked at.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Dates Employed—</strong> Thirdly, put the timeframe of your employment there. You can add the year or both the month and the year, but there's no need to put exact days.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Key Responsibilities—<strong> Don't just list every single task you did in your job history. Focus on the few duties most relevant to the new job.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Key Achievements—</strong> Often overlooked, but super important. Employers know what you did, but they need to know how well you did them.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Keywords—</strong> It is important to sprinkle resume keywords throughout the experience section (we'll talk more about this shortly).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="text-justify">If adding more than one job history entry to your resume or CV experience section, start with the most recent position and go back in reverse-chronological order from there.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Use five or six bullet points to make your case in each entry's responsibilities and achievements.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Also, your experience section resume bullet points should go near the top, just under your heading statement. However, if you have little or no professional experience, put your education section above your work history.</p>

                                    <h5>7. Tailoring your resume work experience</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Robots are taking over.<br/>
                                        As hiring practices continue to modernize, larger companies are turning to applicant tracking systems (ATS) to give them a hand. ATS software automates the early stages of the recruitment process. How? They look for keywords and assign a score per candidate.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">So, tailoring your resume is an absolute must, and your experience section is where you'll do most of it.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">To tailor your resume, go back to the job description and look for resume keywords related to your responsibilities.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">If you see duties you've performed, include them in your resume job description bullet points.<br/>
                                        Experienced a spell of unemployment? Don't worry! Check out our guide on how to explain gaps in your resume.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Tailoring your resume also involves knowing how long a resume should be. There are pros and cons for a one-page resume and the two-page resume, but avoid anything longer.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Also, don't use the same, tired words ("responsible for…") in your resume job experience area. Instead, choose power words and action verbs which will keep them interested. Use present tense to describe your current job and past tense to talk about previous experience.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Finally, don't use passive voice, as it feels evasive and unclear. Instead, choose an active voice when writing a resume, as it's concise and to the point.</p>

                                    <h5>8. How much work experience to include on a resume?</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">In principle, a resume should go back no more than 10-15 years. But the more experience you have, the less you should worry about the length of your resume. Don't go trying to cram everything into a 1 page resume if you're a highly-experienced candidate.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Senior-level applicants, such as executives and managers, should list up to 15 years of relevant work experience with powerful action verbs to introduce each bullet point.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Mid-level job seekers should include detailed job descriptions of relevant positions and a brief mention of any other positions.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Entry-level candidates should list and describe all paid work, particularly calling out responsibilities and achievements that are most relevant.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">First-time job hunters with no work experience can still include other history, such as a student organization role, internship, or volunteer experience, to fill out their experience section.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">As you learn how to write a resume, remember the best resume templates will highlight your experience and eligibility. Don't hide it with the wrong order, a dull resume layout, or a template free of character. With dozens of good resume examples, templates, and styles, Zety is the best resume builder online.</p>

                                    <h5>9. List Your Education Correctly</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Many people treat the education section as an afterthought, but you shouldn't. It's an essential part of your resume structure.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Here's how to put education on your resume so you don't get schooled:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The right resume education order is to place your highest degree first.</li>
                                        <li>Add any other degrees after in reverse-chronological order.</li>
                                        <li>If you finished a university degree, don't add high school info.</li>
                                        <li>Some colleges on a resume are also fine, just list completed credits.</li>
                                        <li>Add any relevant coursework, honors, or awards (e.g., making Dean's List) you received.</li>
                                        <li>Extracurricular activities are a nice finishing touch.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h5>10. Put Relevant Skills that Fit the Job Ad</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Your resume is one of these two: it's either unprepared to be served, or it's a good resume, the prime cut sprinkled with the perfect resume skills.</p>

                                    <h6>Hard skills vs. soft skills</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Hard skills are specific abilities and know-how (e.g., Photoshop, cash register).</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Soft skills are self-developed, life-learned attributes (e.g., social skills, adaptability).</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Combined, these make up a skill set, which is a job seeker's range of skills and abilities.</p>

                                    <h6>What skills to put on a resume?</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">When you consider how to create a resume that will definitely stand out, it has everything to do with sprinkling your skills throughout. But it also makes sense to have a big section labeled "SKILLS."</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Remember that job description you had handy from earlier?</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Use the key job-related skills and keywords listed in that ad to help you create a great resume for a job that will make the ATS light up like Times Square.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Here is a list of some common skills to put on a resume:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Communication skills—</strong> These can include social skills, non-verbal communication, listening skills, and interpersonal skills.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Technical skills—</strong> Knowledge required to perform specific tasks, like computer skills or clerical skills.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Job-specific skills—</strong> Particular prowess the company specifically requires.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Leadership and management skills—</strong> Ability to be a good manager, leader, and supervisor.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Critical thinking skills—</strong> Ability to make your own, thought-based decisions and take initiative. Includes analytical skills, decision-making, and problem-solving.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Organizational skills—</strong> A knack for planning, organizing, and seeing initiatives through.</li>
                                        <li><strongs>Transferable skills—</strong> for career changers, these are abilities you learned that can be carried over to your new position.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h5>11. Include Additional Important Resume Sections</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Here's the thing—everyone's resumes include those sections above. But what should a resume include to make it personalized?</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Make your resume unique by including extra resume sections.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Additional sections on your CV/resume can showcase just about anything about you, from your proud commendations to languages in which you're fluent and more.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Here's how to make your resume stand out with extra sections:</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify"><strong>Hobbies and interests</strong></p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">You might not think that your love of baseball and being the Little League assistant coach would be of interest to a potential employer.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">However, listing your hobbies and interests subtly proves your ability to work well in a team, and the coaching can verify your leadership and management expertise.</p>

                                    <h6>Volunteer Work</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Volunteering boosts employability, studies find. For most job seekers, listing any volunteer experience as one of your additional CV sections is a great way to show your commitment and values. 
                                        It also lets them know that you don't only care about the money. For entry-level or first-time applicants who have no experience, volunteer work makes an excellent stand-in.</p>

                                    <h6>Internship Experience</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Listing internships on your resume is only OK if you're fresh out of school, had one or two other jobs, or you haven't been on the market for longer than 4-5 years.</p>

                                    <h6>Certifications and awards</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Got any certifications, licenses, or proud awards to show off? If they are relevant to the job and industry, include them!</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Placed first in a chili cook-off at the state fair? If you're looking to be a cook, it will definitely help. Likewise, a food safety certification or food handler's license that you already have would surely be in your favor.</p>

                                    <h6>Languages</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Speak another language? Impressive!</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Listing language skills on a resume only extends your usefulness as an employee, particularly in international corporations or localities where there is a large population speaking that second language. 
                                        List the language, international variation (Latin American Spanish, for example), and your language fluency levels.</p>
                                    
                                    <h6>Projects</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">You can include projects as a separate section if you've done a bunch or simply mention one or two below each job description.</p>

                                    <h6>Publications</h6>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Have articles written for a blog, newspaper, or scientific journal? Mention those publications on a resume. If your published material isn't online, create a short bibliography of the works you'd like them to acknowledge.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Also, if you've built graphic designs or other creative creations, or if your list of publications or projects is too long to go on a resume, consider building an online portfolio to document everything. Link to it from the contact section, in this case.</p>

                                    <h5>12. Complement Your Resume With a Cover Letter</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">You need to submit a cover letter, most definitely.<br/>
                                    Your cover letter or job application letter lets you expand upon things that you need to keep brief on your resume. Also, it allows you to speak easily in normal sentences!</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Sounds like overkill?Think again.<br/>
                                    Most employers think a resume is not enough to make a decision.<br/></p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Follow our guide on how to make a cover letter (or a cover letter with no experience or cover letter for an internship), and you'll knock this out quickly and painlessly.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Plus, a great cover letter that matches your resume will give you an advantage over other candidates.</p>

                                    <h5>13. Proofread, Save, and Email Your Resume the Right Way</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">You're almost there, but don't send it off just yet.Here are some resume best practices to keep in mind so you can rest assured that you wrote the perfect resume.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Proofread & double-check<br/>
                                    Double-check your CV or resume draft before sending it out. Scan your resume and cover letter (and email!) with a tool like Grammarly. Then, ask a friend or family member to triple-check. Better safe than sorry!</p>

                                    <h5>14. Online presence</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Remember when we discussed social media and LinkedIn back in the contact section? Well, do you remember the naked pictures you posted onto Facebook several months ago? Yeah, those have to come down.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Before a recruiter or hiring manager gets the chance to look you and your employment history up, you better have your online presence sanitized! That means removing any offensive posts, or at least marking them private while you're preparing your resume. While you're at it, tweak your LinkedIn profile so that it's up-to-date and complete.</p>

                                    <h5>15. Saving your Resume</h5>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Word Doc or PDF? Resumes in PDF are prefered by hiring managers. Recruiters prefer resumes in Microsoft Word .doc format. In the end, go with you like better (and know that our builder will let you download in both file formats). And if you're creating your resume in Word, remember that saving it as a PDF is a better way of preserving your formatting.</p>
